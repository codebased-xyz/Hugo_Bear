# NOTICE: This is a (poorly created) fork of [Hugo Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) theme that I modified and somehow botched making it a fork

## Installation

If you already have a Hugo site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```
git submodule add https://github.com/codebased-xyz/Hugo_Bear.git themes/<themename>
```

Then, add `theme = <themename>` to your config. Adjust the `config.toml` to customize the theme further.
## Further customization
A lot of the things you see can be customized using [params](https://gohugo.io/variables/site/#the-siteparams-variable) in the `config.toml` (or yaml,json) file. Below is a list of the params and what they do:
### Footer params:
- customFooter -> HTML code to be added to the footer (at its end).
- sourceLink -> A link to the source of your site if using a license that requires it or you want to display it. Adds "Get the source code [here](sourceLink)" to the **footer** if present.
- hideMadeWithLine -> If set to `true` hides the "Made posible by ..." line from the footer.
### Header params:
- title -> The title to show in `h1` in the header. !! This is in the global settings and not params !!
- subTitle -> Smaller title to show in `h3` below the title. If present.
## Other params:
- seo -> Disables seo_tags.html partial if `false`.

Everything below is left-over from original repo and will be revised to fit more.

# Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear Blog ![Test](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)

üß∏ A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-theme based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev).

> Free, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging.

## Demo

For a current & working demo of this theme, please check out https://janraasch.github.io/hugo-bearblog/ üéØ.

## Screenshots

‚¨úÔ∏è [Light][light-screenshot]

‚¨õÔ∏è [Dark][dark-screenshot]

When the user's browser is running ¬ªdark mode¬´, the dark color scheme will be used automatically. The default is the light/white color scheme. Check out the [`style.html`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/layouts/partials/style.html)-file for the implementation.


For more information, read the official [setup guide][hugo-setup-guide] of Hugo.

## Adjust configuration / config.toml

Please check out the [config.toml](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) included in the [exampleSite](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/tree/master/exampleSite) of this theme.

## Content & structure

### Starting fresh

If you are starting fresh, simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

### Adding / editing content

#### Index-Page

The contents of the `index`-page may be changed by editing your `content/_index.md`-file.

#### Page

You can add **a new page** via running

```
hugo new my-new-page.md
```

#### Blog-Post

You can add **a new blog-post** via running

```
hugo new blog/my-new-post.md
```

### Adding your branding / colors / css

Add a `custom_head.html`-file to your `layouts/partials`-directory. In there you may add a `<style>`-tag, *or* you may add a `<link>`-tag referencing your own `custom.css` (in case you prefer to have a separate `.css`-file). Check out the [`style.html`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/layouts/partials/style.html)-file to find out which CSS-styles are applied by default.
